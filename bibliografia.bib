abstract="This paper has described the various types of tool integration with the goal of illustrating how diverse tools can be effectively integrated into CASE environments. Issues of data integration, control integration, and presentation integration may be viewed as orthogonal and defining a three-dimensional space in which tool integration occurs. The absence of standards has been shown to be a barrier to integration, as various tool developers remain unable to reach agreement on the appropriate point(s) in this space at which integration should occur. As a result, experience with tool integration has been largely at a tool-to-tool level, with little use of standard tool integration mechanisms.",
